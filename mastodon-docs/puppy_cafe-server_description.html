# Short server description

This Mastodon instance is a closed, invite only community with allow-list based federation.

We have a <a href="https://puppy.cafe/about/more">code of conduct</a> that we adhere to. We try to be proactive in handling moderation, and respond to reports.

<br />
We're not a free speech absolutist. We're not interested in Nazis, TERFS, or hate speech of any sort, which we will define at our sole discretion as moderators.

This instance is meant to be a friendly, welcoming space to all members who are willing to reciprocate in helping to create that environment.
