<p>Puppy.Cafe is a closed, invite only community with allow-list based federation. This is done to minimize abuse for our members.</p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://puppy.cafe/about/more">code of conduct</a> that we adhere to. We try to be proactive in handling moderation, and respond to reports.</p>
<p>We are currently only allowing account creation through invites extended by existing members.</p>
