<p>This Code of Conduct was assembled by David Wolfpaw and provided under a Creative Commons Zero License.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>The data you post here lives on a server that David Wolfpaw runs. He promises that he won't look at your private data.</p>
<p>This is an ActivityPub federated server. This means that other people on other federated servers can find you, send you messages, etc. This also means that any information you put in posts, whether they are public or private, might end up "federated" -- basically, a copy of your post gets put on any server that reads your post.</p>
<p>Once you start talking to people on other servers, all bets are off. Any private message you send to someone on another server could be looked at by the admin of a different server. This is kind of like email: if you are on a private email server, and you send an unencrypted email to a gmail account, congrats, Google now has the content of that email. But also, you do this every day, so, hey. The internet!</p>
